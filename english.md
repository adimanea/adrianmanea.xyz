Hello World!

I'm Adrian Manea, mathematician, teacher and freelance writer, in no particular order.

## Academic
As a mathematician, I have a PhD. degree since 2016, with a thesis which uses homological
methods to study certain types of noncommutative algebras.

Here are my publications in peer-reviewed journals:
- *On Koszulity of Finite Graded Posets* (with Dragoș Ștefan), J. Algebra Appl. 16, 1750139 (2017), 20 pages.
- *The Ext Ring of a Koszul Ring*, Bull. Math. Soc. Sci. Math. Roumanie, Tome 59 (107), No. 1, 2016, pp. 51-63.
- *Further Properties and Applications of Koszul Pairs* (with Dragoș Ștefan), SIGMA 12 (2016), 092, 24 pages.

I've also published an academic article in philosophy of science:
- *The Technically Manifolded (Classical and Quantum) Space Ontology*, Society and Politics, Vol. 11, No. 1, 2017, pp. 91-93

and I've been an academic advisor for the Romanian translation of Albert László Barabási's
book *Linked: The New Science of Networks* (Perseus 2002 for the original, Brumar 2017 for the
translation by Marius Cosmeanu).

## Writing
Since January 2024, my journalistic articles have appeared in the Romanian magazines
[Dilema](https://www.dilema.ro/autor/adrian-manea) and [Mindcraft Stories](https://mindcraftstories.ro/author/adrian-manea/).

I cover popular science topics, book reviews, technology, history and philosophy of science,
and science education.

I've also started a Substack, [Sides of Science](https://sidesofscience.substack.com/), but
haven't been very active lately.

## Teaching
I taught mathematics seminars at the National University of Science and Technology
"Politehnica" of Bucharest, where I covered real and complex analysis, linear algebra,
statistics and probability theory.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have uploaded all my materials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@adrianmanea/videos) and [as notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17tAYZr1smXJ6DIyqr9s7MqV-RcfvyheH?usp=drive_link).

They are all in Romanian.

Lately (since 2022), I've only taught [Cryptography](https://github.com/adimanea/criptografie-upb) 
for undergraduates and [Data Processing and Visualisation Using Python](https://github.com/adimanea/pvdp-upb) for graduates.

My notes are linked, but they are also in Romanian.

As such, you will perhaps find more information on the [Romanian]( ./index.md) page.

## Private Tutoring
In October 2023, I started [Poligon Educational](https://www.poligon-edu.ro/), an educational
platform which I use for private tutoring, courses, and workshops.

I teach high school and college Mathematics and Physics as private lessons, and
organize courses on mathematics, its history and philosophy, aimed at the general public.

Currently, the website and the information therein is in Romanian only, but
I encourage you to get in touch should you have any question or interest in
my activity.

Speaking of which:

## Collaborations and Contact
I'm always interested in collaborations and discussions, as my interests and
curiosity are quite diverse. As such, don't hesitate to get in touch:
- via email at `adrianmanea[at]poligon-edu.ro` (professional) or `adrian.c.manea[at]gmail.com` (personal);
- via [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/message/TPGIYUVXOY7ND1).

I'm not very active on social media, but you can find me on:
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com/adriancostinmanea);
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-manea-89434221b/);
